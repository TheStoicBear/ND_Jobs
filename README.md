I am not the author of these scripts. I simply converted them to be compatible with [ND Framework](https://github.com/Andyyy7666/ND_Framework). Below are the links for the original resources:

- [TrashCollector](https://forum.cfx.re/t/standalone-release-trashmaster-job/4049981)
- [FoodDelivery](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-delivery-jobs-no-need-for-job-system/221649) (modified to make it generic food delivery)
- [DrugTrafficking](https://forum.cfx.re/t/air-trafficking-drugs-job-trashmaster-job-redeaux-standalone/4072328) (modified to make deliveries on vehicles and not airplanes)
- [MailDelivery](https://forum.cfx.re/t/maildelivery-v1-0-2-standalone-mail-delivery-job-for-paleto-bay-grapeseed-and-sandy-shores-extra-esx-addon/168076)
